I spent the last week mostly offline. No social media, minimal email checking, and phone notifications turned off completely.

The difference was immediate.

## What I noticed

Without the constant pull of notifications, my attention felt more solid. Less fragmented. I could actually finish thoughts without reaching for my phone.

Reading became easier. I finished two books this week—something that would normally take me a month.

## The hard parts

The first two days were uncomfortable. Phantom vibrations. The habitual reach for my phone. The anxiety of "missing out" on something important.

Spoiler: I didn't miss anything important.

## Moving forward

I'm not going completely offline, but I'm keeping some of these boundaries:

- Phone stays in another room while working
- No social media before noon
- Email checked twice a day, not constantly

Small changes, but they compound.
