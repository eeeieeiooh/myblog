Clarity doesn't come from more information. It comes from less.

I've been working on decluttering—not just physical stuff, but mental space too. Here's what's helped.

## Morning pages

I write three pages by hand every morning. No agenda, no editing, just stream of consciousness. It's like emptying the dishwasher of my mind.

The first page is usually junk. The second page starts getting interesting. The third page is where clarity shows up.

## Single-tasking

I removed all the tabs. All the windows. One thing at a time.

Sounds obvious, but it's harder than it seems. The urge to check email while compiling, to browse while thinking, to always be consuming something—it's strong.

But single-tasking brings clarity that multitasking never could.

## Saying no

Every yes to something is a no to something else. I've gotten better at protecting my time by saying no to things that don't align with what matters.

It feels uncomfortable at first. Then it feels freeing.

## The result

More clarity means better decisions. Better work. Better relationships. More peace.

It's worth the effort.
