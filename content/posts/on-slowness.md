Everything moves fast. Too fast, usually.

I've been thinking about the value of slowness lately—not as laziness or inefficiency, but as a deliberate choice to move at a more human pace.

## Slow code

When I'm writing code, there's a temptation to just get it working and move on. But some of my best work has come from slowing down. Taking time to refactor. Thinking through edge cases. Writing clear comments.

The code I rush through always comes back to haunt me.

## Slow reading

I used to measure reading by books finished. Now I care more about understanding. Sometimes that means reading slowly, rereading passages, letting ideas settle.

A book read slowly and understood is worth more than ten skimmed.

## Slow decisions

Big decisions deserve slow thinking. Sitting with options. Sleeping on them. Talking them through.

The best decisions I've made were rarely the rushed ones.

## The challenge

Slowness requires intention. It means saying no to urgency culture. It means accepting that some things take time.

But the results speak for themselves.
