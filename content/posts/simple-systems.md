I'm drawn to simple systems. Not simplistic—simple. There's a difference.

Simple systems are easy to understand, easy to maintain, and easy to fix when they break. They do one thing well instead of many things poorly.

## In code

The best codebases I've worked with have been the simplest ones. Clear structure. Minimal dependencies. Straightforward logic.

Complexity creeps in slowly. A helper function here. A new dependency there. Before you know it, you need a PhD to understand what should be a simple feature.

## In productivity

My task management system is a text file. That's it. No kanban boards, no project management software, just a list of things to do.

It works because there's nothing to configure, nothing to update, nothing to sync. Just open the file and write.

## The resistance

Simple systems face resistance because they don't feel impressive. They don't have all the features. They can't do everything.

But that's exactly why they work.

## Keep it simple

When building something new, I try to start with the simplest version that could possibly work. Then I stop.

If I need more later, I can add it. But usually, I don't.
